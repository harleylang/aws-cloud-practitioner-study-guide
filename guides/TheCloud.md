  question:
  - What is "the cloud"?
  - What does "the cloud" refer to in computing?
  - Rather than pay for server hardware, some companies will choose "the cloud". Where does their software live?
  answer:
  - Someone else's computer.
  - A network of computers.
  - A platform that enables your access to a computer network.
  error:
  - Company-owned computer(s).
  - A laptop.
  - text: A local network.
    rationale: You can create your own local cloud-like architecture, yes. But the concept of the cloud is centered on the premise that you do not necessarily need your own hardware.
  foil:
  - text:
    - Your internet browser.
    - The internet.
    rationale: Websites served to you through the internet / your browser may live *in* a cloud, but it is not *the* cloud.
  - text: 
    - The Apple ecosystem.
    - The AWS ecosystem.
    - The Azure ecosystem.
    rationale: A specific company's software offerings is *part* of the cloud but not *the* cloud.
  hint: "The cloud" refers to the concept of renting server hardware rather than purchasing your own. With that in mind, which option would be the best?
